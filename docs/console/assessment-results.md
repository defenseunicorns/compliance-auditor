# Assessment Results

The Assessment Result view provides the Console user with an interactive experience of the OSCAL Assessment Results model. The view supports navigation between the different results contained in the Assessment Results model, as well as the ability to view Findings and Observations in tabular and filterable formats. Additional `detail` views are available to view the raw OSCAL model data for selected Findings/Observations.
