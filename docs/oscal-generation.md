# OSCAL Generation

Lula can generate OSCAL templates to help with authoring OSCAL artifacts. These generation processes help with initial build and maintenance of OSCAL artifacts and keeps with the vision of modular compliance artifacts that live with the source code. 

## Component Definition

To generate a component definition, you need the following context:
- The catalog source `-c` or `--catalog-source`; IE `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usnistgov/oscal-content/master/nist.gov/SP800-53/rev5/json/NIST_SP-800-53_rev5_catalog.json`
- The controls from the catalog to map to `implemented-requirements` / `-r` or `--requirements`; `ac-1,ac-2,au-5`

The following command will generate a component definition with the above context:
```
lula generate component -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usnistgov/oscal-content/master/nist.gov/SP800-53/rev5/json/NIST_SP-800-53_rev5_catalog.json -r ac-1,ac-2,au-5
```

There are optional flags that can be added to the command to generate a component definition:
- The remarks you wish to map from the control parts to the requirement remarks`--remarks`; `assessment-objective,statement,guidance`
- The title of the component `--component`; `Software Title`
- The output file of the component `-o` or `--output`; `oscal-component.yaml`

### Existing Data

The ability to retain data that is put into OSCAL artifacts is of utmost importance to this generation process and also a large feature of continued maintenance of these artifacts. Lula supports the ability to merge newly generated component definition templates into existing component definitions automatically. 

By specifying `--output` or `-o` and providing an existing file - Lula will perform a merge operation that only overwrites specific fields owned by automation.

Lula performs a match on the component title and the provided catalog source to determine placement and merge of the new implemented requirements. This can be used to updated exiting items or as a method to generation of a single artifacts that contains the data for many components or many control implementations. 

## Example 

```bash
./bin/lula generate component -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usnistgov/oscal-content/master/nist.gov/SP800-53/rev5/json/NIST_SP-800-53_rev5_catalog.json -r ac-1,ac-3,ac-3.2,ac-4 -o oscal-component.yaml --remarks assessment-objective 
```
