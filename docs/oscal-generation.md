# OSCAL Generation

Lula has the potential to provide a codified base for how to generate and maintain OSCAL through automation. This means that with a foundation built - Lula can continue to iterate on the methods for mapping maintaining data the aligns with the intent of OSCAL and the standards/benchmarks involved. 

## Generic Generation Concepts

The generation process for OSCAL artifacts created and maintained by Lula should include the following:
- Specification of fields only maintained by automation (Challenge this one)
- Ability to maintain data that is added through manual interaction

## Component Definition Generation
