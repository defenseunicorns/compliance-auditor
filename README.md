# Lula - The Kubernetes Compliance Engine

Lula is a tool written to bridge the gap between expected configuration required for compliance and **_actual_** configuration.

Cloud Native Infrastructure, Platforms, and applications can establish OSCAL documents that live beside source-of-truth code bases. Providing an inheritance model for when a control that the technology can satisfy _IS_ satisfied in a live-environment.

This can be well established and regulated standards such as NIST 800-53. It can also be best practices, Enterprise Standards, or simply team development standards that need to be continuously monitored and validated.

## Why this approach vs a policy engine?

- Lula is not meant to compete with policy engines - rather augment the auditing and alerting process
- Often admission control processes have a difficult time establishing `big picture` global context control satisfaction
- Lula is meant to allow modularity and inheritance of controls based upon the components of the system you build

## How does it work?

Under the hood, Lula has two primary capabilities; Provider and Domains.

- A Domain is an identifier for where to collect data to be validated
- A Provider is the "engine" performing the validation using policy and the data collected.

In the standard CLI workflow:

- Target a `Component-Definition` OSCAL file for validation
  - `lula validate oscal-component.yaml`
- This creates an object in memory for the OSCAL content
- Lula then traverses as required to identify `implemented-requirements` that contain a Lula Validation Payload
- When the payload has been identified:
  - Lula processes provider to understand which provider to use for validation
    - More than one provider can be used in an OSCAL document
  - Lula processes the domain to understand how data is collected (and which data to collect)
  - Lula collects the data for validation as specified in the payload
  - Lula performs validation of the data collected as specified as policy in the payload

## Getting Started

### Try it out

#### Dependencies

- A running Kubernetes cluster
    - Kind
        - `kind create cluster -n lula-test`
    - K3d
        - `k3d cluster create lula-test`
- kubectl
- GoLang version 1.21.x

#### Steps

1. Clone the repository to your local machine and change into the `lula` directory

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/defenseunicorns/lula.git && cd lula
    ```

2. While in the `lula` directory, compile the tool into an executable binary. This outputs the `lula` binary to the `bin` directory.

    ```shell
    make build
    ```

3. Apply the `./demo/namespace.yaml` file to create a namespace for the demo

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f ./demo/namespace.yaml
    ```

4. Apply the `./demo/pod.fail.yaml` to create a pod in your cluster

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f ./demo/pod.fail.yaml
    ```

5. Run the following command in the `lula` directory:

    ```shell
    ./bin/lula validate -f ./demo/oscal-component.yaml
    ```

    The output in your terminal should inform you that the control validated is `not-satisfied`:

6. Now, apply the `./demo/pod.pass.yaml` file to your cluster to configure the pod to pass compliance validation:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f ./demo/pod.pass.yaml
    ```

7. Run the following command in the `lula` directory:

    ```shell
    ./bin/lula validate -f ./demo/oscal-component.yaml
    ```

    The output should now show the pod as passing the compliance requirement:
