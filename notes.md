# Profile Support

Processes that include profile

- generate a comp-def using a profile as source
- comp-def control-implementation source
- generate a catalog (profile resolve?) 
- generate a profile

## Generate Component Support

If the source of an intended generation is a `profile`, we will need to:
- Create a profile object
- Attempt to identify a catalog
  - If found - resolve catalog first -> then perform the mapping
  - If not found?

## Generate a Profile

- Source of artifact
- controls to include
- controls to exclude
-
